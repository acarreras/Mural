## Code
Generative system created with [Processing](www.processing.org) a language for the visual arts.

The algorithm is based on a type of recursive rectangle subdivision to then randomnly add some geometric form. Every time the code it's run the resulting image created is quite different from the previous one. Even though they maintain an aesthetic consistency chosen by design.

## Initial explorations
Grid and forms. Color palette.
